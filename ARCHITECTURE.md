# Slack Agent Bridge — Architecture

*The original design was decided on 2026-07-21 after the
[Claude feasibility study](docs/claude-feasibility.md) and empirical spike.
Codex was added as a provider adapter on 2026-08-14, transactional
cross-provider handoff on 2026-08-17, and Pi on 2026-08-19. The daemon is modern
JavaScript (ESM, Node 20+, no build step); Pi loads one native TypeScript
extension through its own runtime.*

```

- **`bin/sab-cc`** — the Claude launcher. Always wraps the session in **tmux
  inside the terminal window**, exports `CCS_BRIDGE=1` + `CCS_TMUX=<name>`, then
  execs `claude --mcp-config <generated>
  --dangerously-load-development-channels server:slack-bridge [args]`. The MCP
  config is generated at launch into `~/.config/ccs/mcp.json` with the resolved
  install path, so nothing is hardcoded. `bin/ccs` forwards to this launcher.
- **`bin/sab-codex`** — the Codex launcher. It uses the same tmux invariant,
  exports `CCS_PROVIDER=codex`, and binds F12 to Codex `interrupt_turn`. It does
  not load Claude's MCP server or consent watcher. `bin/ccs-codex` forwards to it.
- **`bin/sab-pi`** — the Pi launcher. It exports `CCS_PROVIDER=pi`, preserves
  the shared tmux/Ghostty invariant, consumes bridge-only `--safe`, and loads
  `pi/sab-extension.ts` explicitly with Pi's `--extension`. It never installs
  or discovers a global bridge extension.
- **`pi/sab-extension.ts`** — Pi's native control plane. It opens an
  authenticated-by-local-process SSE stream to the loopback daemon, injects
  prompts and supported images with `sendUserMessage`, posts lifecycle/final
  text and native usage, controls model/thinking/abort, and optionally blocks
  tool calls pending Slack approval. Ordinary owner input is also intercepted
  for adaptive routing; extension-reinjected native prompts bypass the router
  exactly once. Pi session files are not parsed.
- **`pi/managed-run.ts`** — adaptive local-model orchestration controlled by
  `/pi-run`. It persists routing policy/pending decisions and a bounded
  goal/plan state through Pi's extension API,
  drives the parent worker across multiple turns, launches isolated child Pi
  planners/scouts/reviewers, and requires independent review before the final
  response. Planner/reviewer children explicitly load only
  `pi/managed-child-output.ts`, whose typed terminating tools return validated
  plan/review data without an extra prose turn. `pi/managed-core.mjs` contains
  the daemon-safe parser/state model.
- **`bin/sab-upload`** — a provider-neutral agent helper. It submits generated
  file paths to the loopback daemon with the session's provider/tmux identity
  and a one-use grant supplied only by an accepted Slack prompt. It cannot
  choose a channel or user.
- **`bin/sab-automation`** — a JSON-safe loopback client for durable
  create/status/stop automation. Prompts come from a file or stdin rather than
  shell interpolation; the daemon still owns validation, launch, correlation,
  Slack membership, and termination.
- **`hooks/hook.sh`** — registered globally for `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `Stop`. Exits instantly unless `CCS_BRIDGE=1` (non-bridged sessions pay zero cost). Otherwise POSTs the hook JSON + `ppid` + `tmux` name to the daemon (curl, ≤2s cap, always exit 0 — hooks are synchronous).
- **`hooks/codex-hook.sh`** — separately registered and gated by `CCS_PROVIDER=codex`. Lifecycle events post to the daemon; `PermissionRequest` waits for a Slack verdict and emits the documented Codex decision JSON. Failure returns no decision, preserving the local approval flow.
- **Codex resurrection bootstrap** — `codex resume` receives the first queued
  Slack message through its optional `PROMPT` argument. This starts the first
  turn even when an idle resumed TUI has not emitted `SessionStart`; later
  messages remain queued and flush through the normal hook path.
- **`channel/server.mjs`** — MCP channel server, spawned per session by Claude Code. Declares `claude/channel`, connects outward to the daemon's SSE endpoint keyed by its claude PID, and forwards each pushed Slack message into the session as a channel event. No reply tool: outbound mirroring is done by hooks, so responses are verbatim and cost no extra model turns.
- **`daemon/daemon.mjs`** (+ `slackout.mjs`, `util.mjs`) — everything else.

## Key decisions

1. **Message-level bridge, not pty mirroring** — immune to TUI resize bugs (feasibility finding).
2. **JSON state file, not SQLite** — single-writer daemon, dozens of rows, human-inspectable, atomic tmp+rename. (Revised from the earlier SQLite suggestion; complexity wasn't buying anything.)
3. **Provider + PID is the live join key.** Hooks/extensions report their
   process PID; the daemon validates its ancestry and tmux claim for `claude`,
   `codex`, or `pi`. Claude and Pi inbound streams also join by PID. Persisted
   identity remains the raw native session ID, with missing provider fields
   interpreted as Claude for backward compatibility.
4. **No implicit archiving** (design v2). Ended interactive sessions → channel
   gets "💤 write here to resume". A dormant-channel message makes the daemon spawn
   Ghostty+tmux with the provider's native resume form (`sab-cc --resume`,
   `sab-codex resume`, or `sab-pi --session`), queue the message, and deliver it
   after reconnection. The sole lifecycle exception is an explicit
   `POST /automation/sessions/:externalKey/stop` with `{"archive":true}`; it
   archives only the automation's immutable, exact channel ID.
5. **tmux everywhere** (inside the visible Ghostty window — the terminal invariant holds). This solves the two problems the Channels API can't: the research-preview **consent dialog** (daemon auto-acknowledges it in daemon-spawned windows via `send-keys`, since nobody is at the Mac to click it), and **in-session commands** — `/cc-model sonnet` in Slack becomes `tmux send-keys "/model sonnet" Enter`, and `/cc-stop` sends `Escape` to interrupt.
6. **Private channels only; single trusted sender.** The workspace has 35 people. Only messages from `SLACK_USER_ID` are processed; everyone else is silently ignored (and can't see the channels anyway).
7. **Mirroring is provider-event-driven and token-free.** Claude keeps its byte-offset
   JSONL reader and TUI status/form parser. Its bounded poller also recognizes
   new failure-only authentication and overload records, because Claude can
   return immediately to idle without emitting `Stop`; these failures are
   delivered promptly and repeated identical failures are time-deduplicated.
   Codex uses the stable
   `Stop.last_assistant_message` hook field; the bridge never parses Codex's
   explicitly unstable transcript format. Usage and live token counters enter
   only through `ccusage`'s maintained Codex JSON adapter. Pi's native extension
   supplies final text and usage directly; its session JSONL is never read.
   Slack-injected messages are deduped for all providers. A live status edits
   in place normally; because Slack cannot reorder an edited timestamp, newer
   channel activity transactionally replaces it at the bottom and deletes the
   superseded copy.
8. **One control channel** — fresh 1.0 installs use
   `#slack-agent-bridge`; upgrades reuse `#claude-code-bridge`. Its immutable
   channel ID lives in state, so the public rename never creates a duplicate.
   It accepts `/cc-new`, `/codex-new`, or `/pi-new`, provider-filtered status,
   and help.
   Session channels accept plain messages plus their provider namespace.
9. **Capability-bound artifact return.** Every accepted owner or per-channel
   collaborator prompt receives an opaque two-hour grant in the injected agent
   context. `sab-upload` proves live process/tmux ownership; the daemon binds
   the grant to the sender, session, provider, channel, message, and canonical
   workspace. A successful upload consumes the grant. Up to ten regular files
   totaling 100 MiB may be sent in one call; realpath containment rejects
   traversal and symlink escapes. Slack failures and path corrections remain
   retryable until expiry. Grants intentionally do not survive daemon restarts.
10. **One logical channel, separate native provider legs.** A lineage is created
    lazily on the first provider switch; legacy sessions are not
    bulk migrated. `state.channels[channel]` remains the authoritative active
    session mapping. Only the active leg carries `session.channel`; up to two
    other provider-native session IDs remain dormant and resumable.
11. **Journaled two-phase provider handoff.** The source stays authoritative
    while instruction alignment is reviewed and a private SAB v1 handoff is
    captured. The bridge then stops it, starts or resumes the exact target leg
    in a provisional tmux, waits for the visible input surface or Pi extension
    stream, and
    intercepts a read-only readiness turn. Trust gates remain local and are
    never keyed by the daemon. Only a valid response from a hook-claimed target
    session atomically moves the channel mapping. Crash recovery and failures
    reap the exact provisional tmux and restore the source.
12. **Instruction files, not provider memory.** Switch preflight inspects only
    repository-root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Global Claude/Codex memory and
    `MEMORY.md` never enter automatic consolidation. A credential-scrubbed
    auxiliary process runs from a private neutral directory and returns bounded
    document sections; the bridge constructs the Git patch deterministically.
    Owner review plus fingerprint, path, symlink, binary, mode, apply, and size
    validation remain mandatory.
13. **Pi trust has two independent layers.** Pi's `--approve` chooses whether
    project-local resources may load. SAB `--safe` is an extension-owned,
    fail-closed per-tool Slack gate. The bridge never describes one as the
    other, and Pi's unrestricted default does not receive a fictional
    Claude/Codex flag alias.
14. **Managed Pi orchestration is adaptive and bounded.** Ordinary owner prompts
    default to `auto`: an isolated no-tools, low-thinking router chooses native
    delivery or a persisted planning/execution/review state machine. Ambiguous
    or failed classifications promote to managed; collaborators stay native.
    `always` and `native` policies are session-persistent, `/pi-run direct`
    bypasses once, and `/pi-run <goal>` always forces the managed state machine.
    Child processes receive the selected model/thinking setting and role-bound
    tools, but no bridge/session/upload identity, inherited extensions, skills,
    themes, or project-resource approval. Planner/reviewer output uses one
    bridge-owned terminating submission extension; malformed legacy output gets
    at most one no-tools repair attempt. Read-only review is reserved in the
    subagent budget and must pass before the final response is mirrored.
15. **Automation is a journaled ownership protocol, not `/spawn` plus polling.**
    `POST /automation/sessions` persists a unique external key and deterministic
    tmux name synchronously before launch. Repeated keys return that same
    journal. A matching provider `SessionStart` supplies the native session ID
    and channel; collaborators are invited and display-name-resolved one at a
    time, and each allowlist update shares an atomic state checkpoint with its
    setup status. The prompt is claimed and its plaintext removed before the
    one native input side effect. An ambiguous crash is reported and never
    retried. Exact stop validates provider/session/tmux/channel ownership,
    revokes grants, removes only that binding and its relevant lineage/handoff,
    and optionally archives only its recorded channel. It never calls bulk
    cleanup.

## Command grammar (Slack)

Commands are native Slack slash commands (`slash_commands` events over Socket Mode), routed through a shared `dispatch()`. The ingress prefix is authoritative: `/cc-*` selects Claude, `/codex-*` selects Codex, and `/pi-*` selects Pi. A mismatched provider command is rejected before it can affect a session. The old commands were `./`-prefixed messages before v0.2.0.

| Command | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| plain text | session channel | injected into the session (resurrects it first if needed); explicit requests may return generated workspace files |
| `/cc-new [folder] [flags]`, `/codex-new …`, `/pi-new …` | anywhere | provider-specific project picker or Ghostty+tmux spawn (allowlisted flags, under `$HOME`) |
| `/cc-model`, `/cc-effort`, `/cc-flags`, `/cc-update` | Claude session | inspect/change Claude settings; restart/resume where required |
| `/codex-model`, `/codex-effort`, `/codex-flags`, `/codex-update` | Codex session | inspect/change Codex settings; restart/resume where required |
| `/pi-model`, `/pi-effort`, `/pi-flags`, `/pi-update` | Pi session | inspect/change native Pi model/thinking/launch settings |
| `/pi-run [plan] <goal> [--minutes=N --turns=N --agents=N --reviews=N]` | live Pi session | start a managed goal; `plan` pauses after planning; no arguments shows status |
| `/pi-run mode [auto\|always\|native]`, `/pi-run direct <prompt>` | live Pi session | inspect/change persistent adaptive routing or bypass it once |
| `/pi-run approve\|pause\|continue\|cancel` | live Pi session | control the persisted managed run |
| `/cc-stop`, `/codex-stop`, `/pi-stop` | matching session | interrupt the running turn through the provider adapter |
| provider `-switch <target> [new]` | matching active, idle session | preview and transactionally hand the channel to another provider; `new` explicitly replaces missing saved-leg state |
| `/cc-status`, `/codex-status`, `/pi-status` | anywhere | session info here; provider-filtered table from control |
| `/cc-kill`, `/codex-kill`, `/pi-kill` | matching session or control | end a session in the selected provider namespace |
| `/cc-health`, `/cc-cleanup`, `/cc-claim` | anywhere | bridge-wide operations, intentionally singular |
| `/cc-usage`, `/codex-usage`, `/pi-usage` | matching session/control | provider-filtered usage; Pi uses native events, Claude/Codex use `ccusage` |
| `/cc-account` | Claude session/control | Claude-only subscription selection |
| `/cc-help`, `/codex-help`, `/pi-help` | anywhere | provider-specific command list |

## Lifecycle (channel naming: `{repo}-{branch}-{yyyymmdd}-{hhmm}`)

- `SessionStart(startup)` → create private channel, invite you, post header, set topic.
- Concurrent startup hooks share one single-flight channel binding; boot removes
  stale aliases that disagree with the session's authoritative channel ID.
- `SessionStart(resume)` → reuse mapped channel, "▶️ resumed".
- `SessionStart(clear)` → rebind channel to the new session id (same pid), "🧹 cleared".
- `SessionEnd` / liveness sweep (30s, `kill -0`) → "💤 session ended — write here to resume".
- Managed Pi run → read-only child plan → optional approval → repeated parent
  turns and scoped subagents → read-only independent review → fixes/re-review
  or one final mirrored response. Pause, interruption, process exit, and daemon
  restart leave a resumable state entry in the native Pi session.
- Provider switch → preflight → optional reviewed instruction patch → private
  source handoff → provisional target readiness → atomic channel commit. Owner
  messages queue by channel in the private transition journal; collaborators
  are rejected during the transition.
- Switch failure/restart → kill the exact provisional target, restore the source
  mapping, and deliver queued owner work to the restored source.
- A standby leg's late or manual hooks are fenced: it cannot create a duplicate
  channel or become live without the matching provider-switch transaction.
- Topic synchronization reads Slack's current value after daemon boot and writes
  only on a real folder/branch/model/effort change. A real topic write, a manual
  topic change, or a newer channel message re-anchors any active working status
  below the new timeline item.
- You may rename channels freely — mapping is by immutable channel id.

### Automation lifecycle

`pending → launching → awaiting_session → configuring_collaborators →
ready_to_prompt → injecting_prompt → active` is persisted in
`state.automations[externalKey]`. `failed`, `stopping`, and `stopped` are durable
terminal/control states with actionable failure metadata. A restart may issue a
launch only from `pending`; it never repeats `launching` or
`awaiting_session`. A five-minute reconciliation deadline turns a missing tmux
or missing `SessionStart` into an actionable failure without relaunching. It
resumes collaborator setup from its per-user checkpoints,
but a prompt already marked `claimed` is failed as ambiguous rather than sent
again. Synthetic automation prompts bypass the Slack-message ingress and
therefore never mint an artifact grant.

## Known limitations

- Consent dialog on every launch (research preview) — one keypress locally, auto-keyed for remote spawns. Goes away if the plugin ever reaches an allowlist.
- Codex does not expose Claude's whimsical spinner verbs. Its stable working
  status combines hook timing with bounded `ccusage` token snapshots instead.
  A requested `/codex-stop` is reconciled against the exact tracked turn: the
  daemon waits for either `Stop` or the visible idle input surface before
  clearing status, and leaves tracking active with a warning when neither is
  observed. Startup uses the same idle check to discard orphaned interrupt
  status without reading Codex transcripts.
- Pi capabilities depend on its installed version and selected model. Native
  image delivery is rejected visibly for text-only models; Pi has no Chrome
  flag counterpart.
- Managed Pi subagents are sequential and normally use the same configured
  local model as the parent. The bridge supplies orchestration and budgets; it
  cannot make a weak model reason like a stronger one or provide hardware-level
  parallelism on a single inference server.
- Ghostty on macOS has no reliable IPC for adding windows to one running app
  instance. Dockless accessory windows are supported; single-icon mode remains
  best-effort.
- Streaming response APIs are proven but not wired; long responses are uploaded
  as Markdown files.
- Provider switching transfers an explicit summary and repository state, not
  hidden reasoning or a byte-identical context window. Provider-global memory
  remains native and intentionally unmerged.
