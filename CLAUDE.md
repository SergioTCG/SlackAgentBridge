# Claude Code repository instructions

Read and follow `AGENTS.md`; it is the canonical repository and release
contract. This file adds only Claude-specific constraints.

- Preserve the `sab new claude` path, MCP Channel server, and
  `--dangerously-load-development-channels server:slack-bridge` launch path.
- Do not make Codex or Pi behavior the implicit model for Claude. Claude
  retains transcript mirroring, status parsing, consent handling, Chrome flags,
  account binding, and `ccusage` support.
- Generated-file returns use the shared `sab upload` capability. Do not add a
  Claude-only MCP reply/upload path or let an agent choose the Slack channel.
- A state record without `provider` is a Claude session and must remain
  resumable without migration.
- Claude remote defaults use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; `--dsp` is only
  an accepted alias. Explicit flags and the `CCS_NEW_FLAGS` /
  `CCS_RESUME_FLAGS` operator settings override the fallback.
- Changes to Claude hooks, channel startup, consent detection, or transcript
  reading require the existing provider tests plus a local start/resume smoke
  test before release.
- During provider switching, Claude handoff and target-readiness turns are
  private bridge control turns. Do not stream their transcript prose, create a
  second channel for a provisional/standby leg, or bypass the journaled commit.
